### Calculator (2025)

This calculator is a graphical program built using Processing that allows users to perform a variety of basic and scientific math operations. It has a simple layout with buttons for numbers (0–9), decimal points, and operations like addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), and division (÷). It also includes special function buttons such as square (²), square root (√), percentage (%), pi (π), a clear button (C), and a positive/negative toggle (±). Users can click number buttons to input values, choose an operator, and then press “=” to see the result. The calculator works by storing two numbers (left and right) and an operation in between. It displays the current value at the top and updates it as you interact with the buttons. This calculator supports both simple math and a few scientific functions, making it a useful and interactive tool for quick calculations.
